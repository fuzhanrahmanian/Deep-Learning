# Description 

- Load in domain X and Y image data
- Pre-process that data, scaling the pixel values to a desired range
- Define four adversarial networks; two Discriminators and two Generator that utilize convolutional or transpose convolutional layers
- Define adversarial and cycle consistency loss functions
- Train the networks and generate new images
