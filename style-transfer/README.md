# Description 

* Load in a pre-trained VGG Net
* Freeze the weights in selected layers, so that the model can be used as a fixed feature extractor
* Load in content and style images
* Extract features from different layers of our model
* Complete a function to calculate the gram matrix of a given convolutional layer
* Define the content, style, and total loss for iteratively updating a target image
