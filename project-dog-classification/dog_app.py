# In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'(IMPLEMENTATION)'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully! 
# 
# > **Note**: Once you have completed all of the code implementations, you need to finalize your work by exporting the Jupyter Notebook as an HTML document. Before exporting the notebook to html, all of the code cells need to have been run so that reviewers can see the final implementation and output. You can then export the notebook by using the menu above and navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)**. Include the finished document along with this notebook as your submission.
# 
# In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.

# ### Why We're Here 
# 
# In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.  At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!). 
# 
# ![Sample Dog Output](images/sample_dog_output.png)
# 
# In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.  There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

# ## Step 0: Import Datasets
# 
# Make sure that you've downloaded the required human and dog datasets:
# 
# **Note: if you are using the Udacity workspace, you *DO NOT* need to re-download these - they can be found in the `/data` folder as noted in the cell below.**
# 
# * Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in this project's home directory, at the location `/dog_images`. 
# 
# * Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the home directory, at location `/lfw`.  
# 
# *Note: If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder.*
# 
# In the code cell below, we save the file paths for both the human (LFW) dataset and dog dataset in the numpy arrays `human_files` and `dog_files`.

# In[1]:


import numpy as np
from glob import glob # The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although
#results are returned in arbitrary order

# load filenames for human and dog images
human_files = np.array(glob("/data/lfw/*/*"))
dog_files = np.array(glob("/data/dog_images/*/*/*"))

# print number of images in each dataset
print('There are %d total human images.' % len(human_files))
print('There are %d total dog images.' % len(dog_files))


# <a id='step1'></a>
# ## Step 1: Detect Humans
# 
# In this section, we use OpenCV's implementation of [Haar feature-based cascade classifiers](http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html) to detect human faces in images.  
# 
# OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on [github](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).  We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the `haarcascades` directory.  In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image.

# In[2]:


import cv2                #OpenCV:Is a software library that is useful for computer vision and machine learning 
                          # this library can provide pre-trained face detectors 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                        
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# extract pre-trained face detector #class to detect objects in a video stream
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml') 

# load color (BGR) image #cv2.imread() is to read an image.
img = cv2.imread(human_files[0]) 
#function cv2.cvColor(input_image, flag) is used for color conversion
#flag determines the type of the conversion 
# convert BGR image to grayscale 

gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# find faces in image
#The detectMultiScale function executes the classifier stored in face_cascade and takes the grayscale image as a parameter.
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)

# print number of faces detected in the image
print('Number of faces detected:', len(faces))

# get bounding box for each detected face
for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
    # add bounding box to color image
    #cv2.rectangle(img, point1, point2, color[, thickness[, lineType[, shift]]]) â†’ None
    
    cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2)
    
# convert BGR image to RGB for plotting
cv_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# display the image, along with bounding box
plt.imshow(cv_rgb)
plt.show()


# Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images to grayscale.  The `detectMultiScale` function executes the classifier stored in `face_cascade` and takes the grayscale image as a parameter.  
# 
# In the above code, `faces` is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face.  Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face.  The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as `x` and `y`) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box.  The last two entries in the array (extracted here as `w` and `h`) specify the width and height of the box.
# 
# ### Write a Human Face Detector
# 
# We can use this procedure to write a function that returns `True` if a human face is detected in an image and `False` otherwise.  This function, aptly named `face_detector`, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below.

# In[3]:


# returns "True" if face is detected in image stored at img_path
def face_detector(img_path):
    img = cv2.imread(img_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)
    return len(faces) > 0


# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Human Face Detector
# 
# __Question 1:__ Use the code cell below to test the performance of the `face_detector` function.  
# - What percentage of the first 100 images in `human_files` have a detected human face?  
# - What percentage of the first 100 images in `dog_files` have a detected human face? 
# 
# Ideally, we would like 100% of human images with a detected face and 0% of dog images with a detected face.  You will see that our algorithm falls short of this goal, but still gives acceptable performance.  We extract the file paths for the first 100 images from each of the datasets and store them in the numpy arrays `human_files_short` and `dog_files_short`.

# Answer: The percentage of the first 100 images in human_files have a detected human face is : 98% 
# The percentage of the first 100 images in dog_files have a detected human face is: 17%

# In[4]:


from tqdm import tqdm

human_files_short = human_files[:100]
dog_files_short = dog_files[:100]

## Test the performance of the face_detector algorithm 
## on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short.


#vectorization 
face_vectorization = np.vectorize(face_detector)
#recognition of human and dog faces using the vectorize face detector
human_faces = face_vectorization(human_files_short)
dog_faces = face_vectorization(dog_files_short)

#printing the result 
print('percentage of human face detection from human dataset file is {:.2f}%'.format((sum(human_faces)/len(human_faces))*100))
print('percentage of human face detection from dog dataset file is {:.2f}%'.format((sum(dog_faces)/len(dog_faces))*100))


# We suggest the face detector from OpenCV as a potential way to detect human images in your algorithm, but you are free to explore other approaches, especially approaches that make use of deep learning :).  Please use the code cell below to design and test your own face detection algorithm.  If you decide to pursue this _optional_ task, report performance on `human_files_short` and `dog_files_short`.

# <a id='step2'></a>
# ## Step 2: Detect Dogs
# 
# In this section, we use a [pre-trained model](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/models.html) to detect dogs in images.  
# 
# ### Obtain Pre-trained VGG-16 Model
# 
# The code cell below downloads the VGG-16 model, along with weights that have been trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), a very large, very popular dataset used for image classification and other vision tasks.  ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one of [1000 categories](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a).  

# In[6]:


import torch
import torchvision.models as models

# define VGG16 model
VGG16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

# check if CUDA is available
use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()

# move model to GPU if CUDA is available
if use_cuda:
    VGG16 = VGG16.cuda()


# Given an image, this pre-trained VGG-16 model returns a prediction (derived from the 1000 possible categories in ImageNet) for the object that is contained in the image.

# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Making Predictions with a Pre-trained Model
# 
# In the next code cell, you will write a function that accepts a path to an image (such as `'dogImages/train/001.Affenpinscher/Affenpinscher_00001.jpg'`) as input and returns the index corresponding to the ImageNet class that is predicted by the pre-trained VGG-16 model.  The output should always be an integer between 0 and 999, inclusive.
# 
# Before writing the function, make sure that you take the time to learn  how to appropriately pre-process tensors for pre-trained models in the [PyTorch documentation](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html).

# In[7]:

# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Write a Dog Detector
# 
# While looking at the [dictionary](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a), you will notice that the categories corresponding to dogs appear in an uninterrupted sequence and correspond to dictionary keys 151-268, inclusive, to include all categories from `'Chihuahua'` to `'Mexican hairless'`.  Thus, in order to check to see if an image is predicted to contain a dog by the pre-trained VGG-16 model, we need only check if the pre-trained model predicts an index between 151 and 268 (inclusive).
# 
# Use these ideas to complete the `dog_detector` function below, which returns `True` if a dog is detected in an image (and `False` if not).

# <a id='step3'></a>
# ## Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
# 
# Now that we have functions for detecting humans and dogs in images, we need a way to predict breed from images.  In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%.  In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.
# 
# We mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging.  To see why, consider that *even a human* would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.  
# 
# Brittany | Welsh Springer Spaniel
# - | - 
# <img src="images/Brittany_02625.jpg" width="100"> | <img src="images/Welsh_springer_spaniel_08203.jpg" width="200">
# 
# It is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).  
# 
# Curly-Coated Retriever | American Water Spaniel
# - | -
# <img src="images/Curly-coated_retriever_03896.jpg" width="200"> | <img src="images/American_water_spaniel_00648.jpg" width="200">
# 
# 
# Likewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black.  Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.  
# 
# Yellow Labrador | Chocolate Labrador | Black Labrador
# - | -
# <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06457.jpg" width="150"> | <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06455.jpg" width="240"> | <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06449.jpg" width="220">
# 
# We also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%.  
# 
# Remember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning.  Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition.  And, of course, have fun!
# 
# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Data Loaders for the Dog Dataset
# 
# Use the code cell below to write three separate [data loaders](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) for the training, validation, and test datasets of dog images (located at `dog_images/train`, `dog_images/valid`, and `dog_images/test`, respectively).  You may find [this documentation on custom datasets](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html) to be a useful resource.  If you are interested in augmenting your training and/or validation data, check out the wide variety of [transforms](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html?highlight=transform)!

# **Question 3:** Describe your chosen procedure for preprocessing the data. 
# - How does your code resize the images (by cropping, stretching, etc)?  What size did you pick for the input tensor, and why?
# - Did you decide to augment the dataset?  If so, how (through translations, flips, rotations, etc)?  If not, why not?
# 

# Answer:
# for image transformation, I used transforms as Resize, RandomResizeCrop, CenterCrop and Totensor. 
# Resizing the image is done with transforms.Resize and this will give us the images with fixed size of 224. 
# for the train_dataset, I used data augmentation and introduce randomness (RandomResize, RandomRotation and RandomHorizontalFlip) in the input data itself. By this, I can avoid from overfitting , therfore i would have a better performance on my training data and consequently better result in validation and test set. But in the valid and test set, I just used CenterCrop. Finally, at the end I pass them into tensor.

# __Question 4:__ Outline the steps you took to get to your final CNN architecture and your reasoning at each step.  

# Answer: I define a total 3 convolutional layers , in the first 2 layers, I have a convolutional kernels with the size of 3 and stride of 2 which means in each step, we have a downsize of 2. after each step, I used a maxpooling function with the stride of 2 (input image in downsized by 2) , the purpose of this step is discarding the spatial information and gets a deeper network , consequesntly by having a deeper network, more complex pattern and features can be extraxted. 
# In the last convolutional layer , I did not reduce the image input by chooosing stride=1 and kernel size of 3. 
# in the next step, our output image with the depth of 128 is flatten to a vector and pass through the fully connected layer.
# (in convolutional layer , we will get information about the content but we can not predict specifically, therefore we need a fully-connected layer classification)
# Dropout is used in oder to avoid overfitting 
# in the last step (2nd fc layer), we can do prediction , in this case means predicting the classes of the breeds.

# ## Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
# 
# You will now use transfer learning to create a CNN that can identify dog breed from images.  Your CNN must attain at least 60% accuracy on the test set.
# 
# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Data Loaders for the Dog Dataset
# 
# Use the code cell below to write three separate [data loaders](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) for the training, validation, and test datasets of dog images (located at `dogImages/train`, `dogImages/valid`, and `dogImages/test`, respectively). 
# 
# If you like, **you are welcome to use the same data loaders from the previous step**, when you created a CNN from scratch.

# In[28]:


## TODO: Specify data loaders
loaders_transfer = loaders_scratch.copy()


# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Model Architecture
# 
# Use transfer learning to create a CNN to classify dog breed.  Use the code cell below, and save your initialized model as the variable `model_transfer`.

# In[29]:


import torchvision.models as models
import torch.nn as nn

## TODO: Specify model architecture

# In[30]:


#freeze the training for all 'features' layer in resnet50, so the weights will not be considered in the gradient

    param.requires_grad = False

# __Question 5:__ Outline the steps you took to get to your final CNN architecture and your reasoning at each step.  Describe why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

# Answer:
# I used the resnet50 architecture (which has very low top_1 error. Another reason is since ResNet has 3 channels as input and my dog breed images are RGB images, thus this model would be appropriate. The purpose of pretrained model is that we already trained it and the features are extracted. therefore,I freezed the features and i do not want to update the weights. The only thing that should be changed and updated is last layer which is a fc layer (classifier) which we need to train it again.

# __Question 6:__ Is the output better than you expected :) ?  Or worse :( ?  Provide at least three possible points of improvement for your algorithm.

# Answer: 
# 1. First, we can increase the size of our datasets , so the more we train the model, the more it can learn
# 2. we can add more image augmentation ; by doing this first we can avoid from overfitting and second by using another augmentation like moving to right or left(transcriptional) , we can expect a better performance on our test
# 3. Hyper-parameter tuning:several factors can be useful here including initializing the weight, using a better learning learn or even different batch-sizes..
